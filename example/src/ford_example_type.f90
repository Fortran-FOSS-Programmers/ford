  private
  public :: say_interface

  type, abstract, public :: say_type_base
    !! An abstract base type that has a deferred `say` function
  contains
    procedure(say_interface), deferred :: say
    !! Deferred type-bound procedure with a procedure prototype
  end type say_type_base

  type, public :: example_type
    !! Some type that can say hello.
    !!
    !! This type's docs demonstrate how documentation is rendered
    !! differently for public/private components, and for type-bound
    !! procedure bindings and the procedures themselves.

    procedure :: say_hello => example_type_say
    !! This will document the type-bound procedure *binding*, rather
    !! than the procedure itself. The specific procedure docs will be
    !! rendered on the [[example_type]] page.
    !!
    !! This binding has more documentation beyond the summary
    procedure, private, nopass :: say_int
    procedure, private, nopass :: say_real
    generic :: say_number => say_int, say_real
    !! This generic type-bound procedure has two bindings

    final :: example_type_finalise
    !! This is the finaliser, called when the instance is destroyed.
    !!
    !! This finaliser has more documentation beyond the summary
  end type example_type
