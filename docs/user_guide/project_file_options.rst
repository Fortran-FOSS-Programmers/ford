======================
 Project File Options
======================

You can specify various options and information for your project in one of two
ways:

1. with a metadata block at the top of the project file;
2. in the ``extra.ford`` table of your `fpm.toml
   <https://fpm.fortran-lang.org>`_ file (*new in version 7.0*).

We recommend using ``fpm.toml`` for Ford settings as it allows comments and the
syntax is a bit more forgiving. Ford is still run the same way in either case:

.. code:: console

   $ ford <project-file.md>


.. _sec-fpm-toml:

``fpm.toml`` File
-----------------

If you specify options in a ``fpm.toml`` file, you will still need a project
file for the front page of your documentation. The main benefit of using ``fpm.toml``
is the improved semantics from the `TOML <https://toml.io/en/>`_ format, making
it easier to write lists and dicts (arrays and tables in TOML), as well as
supporting comments.

Ford options should appear in the ``[extra.ford]`` table:

.. code:: TOML

   [extra.ford]
   project = "My Project"

   # TOML allows comments, which is handy
   summary = """
   Splitting your summary over multiple lines
   is much easier in TOML.

   It also allows blank lines in multi-line strings.
   """

   preprocess = true
   display = ["public", "protected"]
   max_frontpage_items = 4
   # An array of inline tables:
   extra_filetypes = [
     { extension = "cpp", comment = "//" },
     { extension = "sh", comment = "#", lexer = "bash" },
     { extension = "py", comment = "#", lexer = "python" },
   ]


If an ``fpm.toml`` file with the ``[extra.ford]`` table exists in the same
directory where you run ``ford``, it will be automatically used and any metadata
block in the project file will be ignored.

.. note:: If you use LaTeX in an option value, you probably want to use literal
          strings with single quotes to avoid errors about "Unknown escape character"

Markdown metadata
-----------------

Specifying options via the metadata block in the project file uses the same
syntax as the `Markdown Meta-Data
<https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/meta_data/>`__ extension, and
consists of a single block at the top of the file, and ends with either a single
blank line or triple-dashes ``---``.

Metadata consists of a series of keywords and values defined at the
beginning of a markdown document like this:

.. code:: yaml

   ---
   project: My Project
   summary: This is a summary of the project
       split over multiple lines (without any
       blank lines!)
   preprocess: true
   display: public
            protected
   max_frontpage_items: 4
   extra_filetypes: cpp //
       sh # bash
       py # python
   ---

   This is the first paragraph of the document.

The keywords are case-insensitive and may consist of letters, numbers,
underscores and dashes and must end with a colon. The values consist of anything
following the colon on the line and may even be blank.

If a line is indented by 4 or more spaces, that line is assumed to be an
additional line of the value for the previous keyword. A keyword may have as
many lines as desired -- note that these **must** be spaces and not tabs. Also
note that you cannot have any blank lines in a list item or they will be
interpreted as closing the metadata block.

The first blank line ends all metadata for the document. Therefore, the first
line of a document must not be blank. All metadata is stripped from the document
prior to any further processing by Markdown.

Project file options will be overriden by `command line options
<sec-command-line-options>` .See `./example/example-project-file.md
<https://github.com/Fortran-FOSS-Programmers/ford/blob/master/example/example-project-file.md>`__
for a sample project file.

Except where noted, all paths in options are interpreted relative to the path of
the project file.

.. note::

   Markdown comments must not appear within the meta data section!
   Typical markdown commenting strategies may be used within the markdown
   body of the project file, BUT NOT WITHIN THE META-DATA SECTION! After
   declaring metadata HTML block comments of the form

   .. code:: html

      <!-- This is a multi line
      comment!

      wow
      -->

   or markdown phony link comments may be used:

   .. code:: markdown

      [comment 1 goes here, this will declare a phony link target. Just make sure not to reference the null anchor]:#


Unless stated, most options are plain strings:

.. tab:: fpm.toml

   .. code:: toml

      doc_license = "by-sa"

.. tab:: Markdown metadata

   .. code:: yaml

      doc_license: by-sa

If an option is a list, it can take multiple values. Note that for
markdown-metadata, each value must be on its own line and indented by at least
four spaces:

.. tab:: fpm.toml

   .. code:: toml

      macro = [
        "HAS_DECREMENT",
        "DIMENSION=3",
      ]

.. tab:: Markdown metadata

   .. code:: yaml

      macro: HAS_DECREMENT
          DIMENSION=3

`sec-copy_subdir` for a more detailed explanation of this option. (*optional*)


.. _option-exclude_dir:

exclude_dir
^^^^^^^^^^^

List of directories whose contents should not be included in
documentation. Provide the relative path to directory from the top level project
file. Can be a glob pattern, for example ``**/test*``, which will match any
directory that starts with ``test`` anywhere in the source directory tree.

.. tab:: fpm.toml

   .. code:: toml

      exclude_dir = [
        "**/test*",
        "src/internal",
      ]

.. tab:: Markdown metadata

      exclude_dir: **/test*
          src/internal

.. _option-html_template_dir:

html_template_dir
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A list of directories to search for HTML templates.

.. caution:: This is an experimental feature!

   You will most likely want to copy-paste the existing templates and
   modify them. They are not well documented, so use at your own risk!

.. _option-include:

include
^^^^^^^

Directories in which the C preprocessor searches for any
``#include``\ ed files, such as headers. These directories will also be
searched for files loaded using Fortran’s intrinsic ``include``
statement.

.. _option-media_dir:

media_dir
^^^^^^^^^

A directory containing any images or other content which you will use or link to
in your documentation. This will be placed at the root of your documentation
file-tree, with the name “media”. The URL of this directory can be accessed
within your documentation using the `macro <option-macro>`
``|media|``.

.. _option-md_base_dir:

md_base_dir
^^^^^^^^^^^

The directory relative to which any “included” Markdown files’ paths are
specified. (*default:* directory containing the project file.)

.. _option-page_dir:

page_dir
^^^^^^^^

A directory containing markdown files to be processed into individuals
pages within the documentation. See `sec-writing-pages` for details.

.. _option-src_dir:

src_dir
^^^^^^^

List of directories where the source-files are to be found for this project.
These must not be a subdirectory of the `option-output_dir` (see
below). (*default:* ``["./src"]``)

Source File Settings
--------------------

Settings related to individual source files.

.. _option-encoding:

encoding
^^^^^^^^

The text encoding to use when opening source files (*default*: ``utf-8``)

.. _option-exclude:

exclude
^^^^^^^

List of source files which should not be included in documentation. This should
either be a relative path that includes one of the source directories, or a glob
pattern. For example, ``src/not_this.f90`` to exclude a specific file, or
``**/test_*.f90`` to exclude any ``.f90`` files that start with ``test_``
anywhere in any of the source directories.

.. deprecated:: 7.0.0
   In earlier versions, ``not_this.f90`` would exclude any file called
   ``not_this.f90`` anywhere in the project. This will now emit a warning,
   and should be changed to either a relative path (``src/not_this.f90``) or
   a glob pattern (``**/not_this.f90``)


.. tab:: fpm.toml

   .. code:: toml

      exclude = [
        "**/test_*.F90",
        "src/generated_file.f90",
      ]

.. tab:: Markdown metadata

   .. code:: text

      exclude: **/test_*.F90
          src/generated_file.f90


.. _option-extensions:

extensions
^^^^^^^^^^

List of file extensions (without the dot) which will be read by FORD for
documentation. These extensions are only for free-form code; see
`option-fixed_extensions` for fixed-form extensions. (*default:* f90, f95, f03,
f08, f15, F90, F95, F03, F08, F15)

.. tab:: fpm.toml

   .. code:: toml

      extensions = ["f90", "f", "F90", "F"]

.. tab:: Markdown metadata

   .. code:: yaml

      extensions: f90
          f
          F90
          F

.. _option-extra_filetypes:

extra_filetypes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

List of non-Fortran filetypes from which documentation should be extracted (see
`non-fortran-source-files`).

*Experimental:* You may optionally specify the `Pygments lexer
<http://pygments.org/docs/lexers/>`__ to use when applying syntax-highlighting
to the file, as an additional argument after the comment character. This should
take the form of the module being imported relative to ``pygments.lexer``,
e.g. ``fortran.FortranLexer`` or ``c_cpp.CLexer``. This feature should not be
considered stable and the behaviour may change in future releases. If you don't
supply this, pygments will guess which lexer to use based the file extension and
some lexical analysis.

For TOML config files, this should be a list of tables with required keys
``extension`` and ``comment``, and an optional ``lexer``.

For Markdown metadata config, each entry must be on its own line and should
consist of the filetype extension, a space, and then the character(s)
designating a comment. Only single-line comments are supported.

.. tab:: fpm.toml

   .. code:: toml

      extra_filetypes = [
        { extension = "cpp", comment = "//" },
        { extension = "sh", comment = "#", lexer = "bash" },
        { extension = "py", comment = "#", lexer = "python" },
      ]

.. tab:: Markdown metadata

   .. code:: yaml

      extra_filetypes: cpp //
          sh # bash
          py # python


.. _option-fixed_extensions:

fixed_extensions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

List of file extensions which will be read by FORD for documentation, with the
files containing fixed-form code. (*default*: f, for, F, FOR)

.. _option-fixed_length_limit:

fixed_length_limit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If false, fixed-form code lines are read in their entire length.
Otherwise anything after the 72nd column is ignored. (*default:* true)

Preprocessing
-------------

If desired, your source files can be passed through an arbitrary
preprocessor before being analysed by FORD.

.. _option-fpp_extensions:

fpp_extensions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

File extensions which should be preprocessed prior to further analysis.
If the extension is not specified in
`extensions <option-extensions>`
or
`fixed_extensions <option-fixed_extensions>`
then the file will be assumed to be free-form. (*default:* F90, F95,
F03, F08, F15, F, FOR)

.. _option-macro:

macro
^^^^^

List of macros to be provided to the C preprocessor when applying it to source
files. Can take the form ``mac-name`` or ``mac-name=mac-value``.

.. tab:: fpm.toml

   .. code:: toml

      macro = [
        "HAS_DECREMENT",
        "DIMENSION=3",
      ]

.. tab:: Markdown metadata

   .. code:: yaml

      macro: HAS_DECREMENT
          DIMENSION=3

.. _option-preprocess:

preprocess
^^^^^^^^^^

If set to ‘true’, then any files with extensions in
`fpp_extensions <option-fpp_extensions>`
will be passed through the specified preprocessor, CPP by default.
(*default:* true)

.. _option-preprocessor:

preprocessor
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The preproccessor command to use on files with extensions in `fpp_extensions
<option-fpp_extensions>`. Can include flags as needed. Preprocessor macros and
include paths specified in the project file will automatically be appended using
the CPP interface, which is fairly standard. (*default*: ``pcpp -D__GFORTRAN__``)

Documentation Markers
---------------------

.. _option-docmark:

docmark
^^^^^^^

The symbol(s) following an exclaimation mark which designates that a
comment contains documentation. For example, if the docmark was ``!``,
comments would then be designated by ``!!``. It should not be the same
as any other docmark. (*default:* ``!``)

.. _option-docmark_alt:

docmark_alt
^^^^^^^^^^^

The symbol(s) following an exclaimation mark which designate that the
following set of comments, until the end of the block, are all
documentation. This mark needs only to be used at the beginning of the
block, after which all regular comments will be treated as
documentation. For example, if the docmark was ``*``, comments would
then be designated by ``!*``. An example of such a block of
documentation is provided.

.. code:: fortran

   !* This is an example.
   !  Here is another line of comments.
   !
   !  History
   ! ----------
   !  * 1/1/2000 Created

   subroutine blah()

   end subroutine blah

It should not be the same symbol as any other docmark. (*default:*
``*``)

.. _option-predocmark:

predocmark
^^^^^^^^^^

The symbol(s) following an exclaimation mark which designates that a
comment contains documentation preceding the code which it is
documenting. For example, if the docmark was ``>``, comments would then
be designated by ``!>``. It should not be the same as any other docmark.
(*default:* ``>``)

.. _option-predocmark_alt:

predocmark_alt
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The symbol(s) following an exclaimation mark which designate the start
of a block of documentation preceding the code which it is documenting
and that all further comments within this block will be treated as
documentation. For example, if the predocmark_alt was ``#``, comments
would then be designated by ``!#``. It should not be the same as any
other docmark. (*default:* ``|``)

Documentation Settings
----------------------

Settings specifying how to process documentation and what information to
display in the output.

.. _option-alias:

alias
^^^^^

List of aliases in the form ``key = replacement``. In the documentation
``|key|`` can then be used as shorthand for ``replacement``. For
example:

.. tab:: fpm.toml

   .. code:: toml

      # As an in-line table (note that this has to all be on one line!)
      alias = {ford = "FORD (the Fortran documentation generator", euler = '\exp(i \pi) + 1 = 0'}

      # Or as a separate table:
      [extra.ford.alias]
      ford = "FORD (the Fortran documentation generator"
      euler = '\exp(i \pi) + 1 = 0'

.. tab:: Markdown metadata

   .. code:: yaml

      alias: ford = FORD (the Fortran documentation generator)
             euler = \exp(i \pi) + 1 = 0

and the markdown:

.. code:: markdown

   This code uses |ford|.
   Did you know Euler's identity is $$|euler|$$?

becomes:

.. code:: markdown

   This software uses FORD (the Fortran documentation generator).
   Did you know Euler's identity is $$\exp(i \pi) + 1 = 0$$?

Three aliases are pre-defined:

- ``|url|`` for the project URL,
- ``|media|`` for the media directory, and
- ``|page|`` for the ``page_dir``.

Note:
'''''

Aliases can currently only be defined in the project file, and not in
individual docstrings

.. _option-creation_date:

creation_date
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A Python `datetime
format <https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior>`__
to be used if the date and time at which the documentation was generated
is printed in the documentation footer. (*default*:
``%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f%z``)

.. _option-css:

css
^^^

The path to a custom style-sheet which can be used to modify the
appearance of the output.

.. _option-display:

display
^^^^^^^

How much documentation should be printed. Options are ‘public’, ‘private’,
‘protected’, or any combination of those three. If ‘none’ is present, then
nothing will be displayed other than the programs, modules, and procedures
contained within source files (that is, procedures within modules will not be
displayed). These choice can be overridden for a specific item using the
`documentation meta data <metadata-display>`, and those settings will be
inherited by any items they contain. (*default:* ‘public’ and ‘protected’)

.. _option-external:

external
^^^^^^^^

Paths or URLs of external projects to link to. If an entity is not found in the
sources, FORD will try to look it up in those external projects. If those have
documentation generated by FORD with the externalize option, a link will be
placed into the documentation wherever this entity is referred to. FORD will
look in the provided paths for a ``modules.json`` file.

The difference between ``external`` between ``extra_mods`` is that FORD can link
directly to entities (functions, types, and so on) with ``external``, while only
modules will be linked to using ``extra_mods``.

.. _option-extra_mods:

extra_mods
^^^^^^^^^^

A list of modules (and their external documentation) which are not included in
the project. For the markdown metadata, an entry takes the form
``module_name:url`` where ``module_name`` is its name as it would appear in a
``use`` statement, and ``url`` is the location of its documentation. For TOML
options, use a table with ``module_name = "url"`` as the key-value pairs. Any
entity which uses this module will provide a link to the external documentation
in the same way that it would provide a link to the documentation of a module in
the project.

.. tab:: fpm.toml

   .. code:: toml

      # As an inline table:
      extra_mods = { example_mod = "https://example.com" }

      # Or you might find it easier as a separate table:
      [extra.ford.extra_mods]
      iso_fortran_env = "https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gfortran/ISO_005fFORTRAN_005fENV.html"
      example_mod = "https://example.com"

.. tab:: Markdown metadata

   .. code:: yaml

      extra_mods: iso_fortran_env: "https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gfortran/ISO_005fFORTRAN_005fENV.html"
            example_mod: https://example.com


.. _option-extra_vartypes:

extra_vartypes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A list of extra types of variables which FORD should look for. This can be
useful when using, for example, the PETSc library.

.. _option-hide_undoc:

hide_undoc
^^^^^^^^^^

If ``true``, then don't display any undocumented entities (*default*: ``false``)

.. _option-incl_src:

incl_src
^^^^^^^^

This flag toggles visibility of the source files in FORD documentation
output. If set to ``true``, the individual files will be listed and
all contents will be shown on a file page. If ``false``, procedures
will still show the names of the files they are defined in, but there
will be no way to access the contents of the file itself. For showing
the code definitions for individual procedures, modules, and derived
types, see `option-source`. (*default*: ``true``)

.. _option-lower:

lower
^^^^^

If ``true`` then convert all non-string and non-comment source code to
lower case prior to analyzing. (*default*: ``false``)

.. _option-mathjax_config:

mathjax_config
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The path to a JavaScript file containing `settings for MathJax
<https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/configuration.html#using-plain-javascript>`__.
This might be used to, e.g., `define TeX macros
<https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/tex.html#defining-tex-macros>`__.

.. _option-max_frontpage_items:

max_frontpage_items
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The maximum number of items to list under each category of entity on the front
page. (*default*: 10)

.. _option-md_extensions:

md_extensions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

List of Markdown extensions which you wish to be used when parsing your
documentation. For example, ``markdown.extensions.toc``. Note that
Markdown-Extra, CodeHilite, and Meta-Data are loaded by default.

.. _option-print_creation_date:

print_creation_date
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If ``true`` then will print the date and time of creation, using the
specified `date format <option-creation_date>`, in the footer of each
page of documentation. (*default*: ``false``)

.. _option-proc_internals:

proc_internals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If ``false`` then the local variables, derived types, etc. within
public procedures will not be included in documentation. This is
equivalent to setting ``display: none`` in the documentation meta data
of each procedure. It can be overriden locally in the `documentation
meta data <metadata-proc_internals>`.  (*default*: ``false``)

.. _option-revision:

revision
^^^^^^^^

The name of the particular revision of your code/documentation, to be
printed in the footer below the license and copyright year.

.. _option-search:

search
^^^^^^

If ``true`` then add a search feature to the documentation. This can
be time-consuming, so you may want to turn it off for large
projects. Note that this process can be sped up if the `lxml
<http://lxml.de/>`__ library is installed. (*default*: ``true``)

.. _option-sort:

sort
^^^^

The order in which to display entities (variables, procedures, etc.) in
the documentation. Options are (*default:* ``src``)

* ``src``: Order which they occur in source code
* ``alpha``: Alphabetical order
* ``permission``: Display public first, then protected, then private.
  Within these categories, items are displayed in the same order as
  they occur in the source code.
* ``permission-alpha``: Display public first, then protected, then
  private. Within these categories, items are displayed in
  alphabetical order.
* ``type``: Sort variables (and functions) by type. For each time,
  items are displayed in the same order as they occur in the source
  code
* ``type-alpha``: Sort variables (and functions) by type. Within these
  categories, items are displayed in alphabetical order.

.. _option-source:

source
^^^^^^

If set to ‘true’, then the syntax-highlighted source code will be
displayed at the bottom of the documentation page for each procedure,
program, and derived type. This behaviour can be overridden for a
given item using the `documentation meta data <metadata-source>`.
FORD may not be able to extract the source code in all cases; see
`metadata-source` for details. To hide source files themselves, see
`option-incl_src`.  Note that this substantially increases
run-time. (*default:* ``false``)

.. _option-version:

version
^^^^^^^

The version name/number of your project.

.. _option-year:

year
^^^^

The year to display in the copyright notice. (*default:* the current
year)

Graph Settings
--------------

FORD can generate call-trees, dependency diagrams, and inheritance
diagrams will be produced for the project. These require
`Graphviz <http://graphviz.org/>`__ to be installed. Note that this can
increase run-time substantially. The following graphs are produced: -
For each module: - a graph showing the modules which it ``use``\ s and,
if a submodule, the (sub)modules it is descended from - a graph showing
which modules ``use`` and which submodules descend from this one - For
each type: - a graph showing all type which it descends from or contains
as a component - a graph showing all types which descend from or contain
as a component this type - For each procedure: - a graph showing all
procedures called by this procedure and (for interfaces) any procedures
which it provides an interface to - a graph showing all procedures which
call this one or provide and interface to it - For each program: - a
graph showing the modules which are ``use``\ d by the program - a graph
showing the procedures called by the program - A graph showing all
module ``use`` dependencies on the module list page - A graph showing
the inheritance structure of all derived types (and their use as
components of other types) on the type list page - A graph showing the
call-tree for all programs and procedures on the procedure list page

Note that, at present, call-trees only work for procedural programming
and will not identify any calls to type-bound procedures. Call-trees are
not supposed to show intrinsic procedures. However, intrinsic procedures
and even keywords may appear in a grey node on the graph. This means
that it this procedure was not known (or overlooked) by the developers.
Please report this is a bug. (*default:* ``false``)

.. _option-coloured_edges:

coloured_edges
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If ``true`` then edges connecting nodes in the graphs will be assigned
various colours. This can make large graphs easier to read. Americans,
please note that the proper spelling has been used here. (*default*:
``false``)

.. _option-graph:

graph
^^^^^

If set to ‘true’ then graphs are produced of call trees, dependency
structures, and inheritance diagrams. This behaviour can be overridden
for a given item in the code using the `documentation meta data
<metadata-graph>`.  (*default:* ``false``)

.. _option-graph_maxdepth:

graph_maxdepth
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The maximum number of recursions to make when analysing graph
structures. For large projects, producing graphs can be prohibitively
time-consuming and the graphs confusing and unreadable if full recursion
is used, so you may wish to set the maximum to be only a few levels.
(*default:* 10000)

.. _option-graph_maxnodes:

graph_maxnodes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The maximum number of nodes which may be displayed in a graph. For large
projects, graphs become unreadable if they contain too many nodes. A
graph’s depth will be reduced to keep the number of nodes below this
maximum or, if the even a depth of one would result in more nodes than
the maximum, it will be restructured to give a clearer visualisation.
(*default:* 100000000)

.. _option-show_proc_parent:

show_proc_parent
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If ``true`` then the parent module of a procedure will be displayed in
the graphs as follows: parent::procedure.
(*default:* ``false``)

Output
------

Where documentation should be written to.

.. _option-externalize:

externalize
^^^^^^^^^^^

Create a ``modules.json`` file under `option-output_dir` containing information
about entities and the URL of their documentation. This allows this project to
be used as an `option-external` link in another project.

.. _option-graph_dir:

graph_dir
^^^^^^^^^

A directory where, if it is specified and ``graphs`` is set to ``true``,
SVG and graphviz copies of all graphs for your project will be placed.
Note that name mangling is applied to the filenames.

.. _option-output_dir:

output_dir
^^^^^^^^^^

The directory where the project output will be placed. **Any content already
present there will be deleted.** (*default:* ./doc)

Run-Time Behaviour
------------------

Miscellaneous options determining how FORD is run and its output.

.. _option-dbg:

dbg
^^^

Allows FORD to crash and display a Python backtrace if an error is
encountered when parsing a file.

.. _option-force:

force
^^^^^

Try to continue as much as possible, even if there are fatal errors when reading
files.

.. _option-parallel:

parallel
^^^^^^^^

The number of CPUs to in multithreading. 0 indicates that the code
should be run in serial. (*default:* number of cores on the computer)

.. _option-quiet:

quiet
^^^^^

If ‘true’, FORD will suppress all output documenting its progress.
(*default:* false)

.. _option-warn:

warn
^^^^

If ‘true’, FORD will print warning messages for any undocumented items
which it encounters and any time it can not find the source code for
some item where it is requested as part of the documentation.
(*default:* false)
