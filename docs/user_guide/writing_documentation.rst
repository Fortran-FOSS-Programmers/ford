=======================
 Writing Documentation
=======================

FORD usage is based on *projects*. A project is just whatever piece of
software you want to document. Normally it would either be a program
or a library. Each project will have its own `Markdown
<http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax>`__ file which
contains a description of the project. For details on some of the
non-Markdown syntax which can be used with FORD, see below. Various
`options <sec-project-options>` can be specified in this file,
such as where to look for your projects source files, where to output
the documentation, and information about the author. See
`example-project-file.md
<https://github.com/Fortran-FOSS-Programmers/ford/blob/master/example/example-project-file.md>`__
for a sample project file.

Other documentation is placed within the code. This is described in more
detail below.

Indicating Documentation
------------------------

In modern (post 1990) Fortran, comments are indicated by an
exclamation mark (``!``). FORD will ignore a normal comment like
this. However, comments with two exclamation marks (``!!``) are
interpreted as documentation and will be captured for inclusion in the
output. If desired, the character(s) designating documentation
`can be changed <option-docmark>`. By default, FORD documentation
comes *after* whatever it is that you are documenting, either at the
end of the line or on a subsequent line. This was chosen because it
was felt it is easier to make your documentation readable from within
the source-code this way. This::

   subroutine feed_pets(cats, dogs, food, angry)
       !! Feeds your cats and dogs, if enough food is available. If not enough
       !! food is available, some of your pets will get angry.

       ! Arguments
       integer, intent(in)  :: cats
           !! The number of cats to keep track of.
       integer, intent(in)  :: dogs
           !! The number of dogs to keep track of.
       real, intent(inout)  :: food
           !! The ammount of pet food (in kilograms) which you have on hand.
       integer, intent(out) :: angry
           !! The number of pets angry because they weren't fed.

       !...
       return
   end subroutine feed_pets

looks better/more readable than::

   !! Feeds your cats and dogs, if enough food is available. If not enough
   !! food is available, some of your pets will get angry.
   subroutine feed_pets(cats, dogs, food, angry)

       ! Arguments
       !! The number of cats to keep track of.
       integer, intent(in)  :: cats
       !! The number of dogs to keep track of.
       integer, intent(in)  :: dogs
       !! The ammount of pet food (in kilograms) which you have on hand.
       real, intent(inout)  :: food
       !! The number of pets angry because they weren't fed.
       integer, intent(out) :: angry

       !...
       return
   end subroutine feed_pets

in the opinion of this author, especially with regards to the list of
arguments. Since version 1.0.0 it is now possible to place
documentation before the code which it is documenting. To do so, use
the ``predocmark``, which is set to ``>`` by default (it may be
changed in the specify in the metadata of your `project file
<sec-project-options>`).  In the first line of your preceding
documentation, use ``!>`` rather than the usual ``!!``. This can be
used on all lines of the preceding documentation if desired, but this
is not necessary.

For longer blocks of documentation, it can be inconvenient to
continually type the “docmark”. For such situations, the ``docmark_alt``
(set to ``*`` by default) may be used in the first line of the
documentation comment. Any immediately following lines containing only a
comment will then be included in the block of documentation, without
needing the “docmark”. The same effect can be achieved for preceding
documentation by using the ``predocmark_alt``, set to ``|`` by default.
Both of these may be changed in the project file metadata.

Legacy fixed-form FORTRAN code is now supported, using the `fixed2free
<https://github.com/ylikx/fortran-legacy-tools/tree/master/fixed2free>`__
utility. Files with extensions ``.f``, ``.for``, ``.F``, or ``.FOR``
are interpreted as fixed-form, but these settings can be changed in
the `project file <option-fixed_extensions>`. However, from a
stylistic point of view, it is strongly recommended that free-form
Fortran is used for all new code; this feature has only been added to
support legacy code.

By default, FORD will preprocess any files with extensions ``.F90``,
``.F95``, ``.F03``, ``.F08``, ``.F15``, ``.F``, or ``.FOR`` prior to
parsing them for documentation. This behaviour can `be disabled
<option-preprocess>` or `different extensions <option-fpp_extensions>`
can be specified, if desired. Note that any syntax-highlighted source
code which is displayed in the output will be shown in its
non-preprocessed form. The default preprocessor is `pcpp
<https://github.com/ned14/pcpp>`_, which is a C preprocessor
implemented in Python, but you can `customise this command
<option-preprocessor>`.

Markdown
--------

All documentation, both that provided within the source files and that
given in the project file, should be written in `Markdown`_. In
addition to the standard Markdown syntax, you can use all of the
features in Python’s `Markdown Extra`_. Other Markdown extensions
automatically loaded are `CodeHilite`_, which provides syntax
highlighting for code fragments in your documentation, and
`Meta-Data`_, which is used as a way to provide extra information
and/or customize behaviour. See :ref:`sec-doc-metadata` for the syntax
and what metadata you can set.

.. _Markdown: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax
.. _Markdown Extra: https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/extra.html
.. _CodeHilite: https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/code_hilite.html
.. _Meta-Data: https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/meta_data.html

LaTeX Support
-------------

You can insert LaTeX into your documentation, which will be rendered
by `MathJax <http://docs.mathjax.org>`__. Inline math is designated by
``\(...\)``, math displayed on its own line is indicated by
``$$...$$`` or ``\[...\]``, and a numbered equation is designated by
``\begin{equation}...\end{equation}``. Inline math will not be
displayed with the traditional ``$...$``, as there is too much risk
that dollar signs used elsewhere will be misinterpreted. You can refer
back to number equations as you would in a LaTeX document. For more
details on that feature, see the `MathJax Documentation
<http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/input/tex/eqnumbers.html>`__.

.. _sec-note-boxes:

Notes and Warning Boxes
-----------------------

If you want to call particular attention to a piece of information,
you can use the ``@note`` markup to place it in a highlighted box:

.. code:: markdown

    @note
    You can include any notes (or bugs, warnings, or todos) like so.
    @endnote

becomes:

.. figure:: note_box.png
   :alt: An example of a @note box

   An example of a ``@note`` box

This syntax may be used at almost any location in the documentation
comment and it will include as the note’s contents anything until the
first use of ``@endnote`` (provided there are no new ``@note`` or
other boxes, described below, started before then). If no such
``@endnote`` tag can be found then the note’s contents will include
until the end of the paragraph where the environment was activated.

There are some variations on ``@note`` boxes, which are coloured
differently:

- ``@note``
- ``@warning``
- ``@todo``
- ``@bug``
- ``@history``

You can give them a custom title by putting it in quotes immediately
after the tag:

.. code:: markdown

    @note "Custom title"
    Note text
    @endnote

These boxes all use the CSS class ``alert``, as well as
``alert-<name>`` (for example, ``alert-note``), so you can customise
them if you wish. You can even add your own CSS classes, although you
must also give a title in that case:

.. code:: markdown

    @note highlight blink "Title"
    Note text
    @endnote

Note that these tags are case-insensitive (which, as Fortran
programmers, we’re all used to). If a note is used within the first
paragraph of something’s documentation and you do not manually specify
a summary, then the note will be included in the summary of your
documentation. If you do not want it included, just place the note in
a new paragraph of its own.

Notes can include other markdown, such as lists or code blocks, and
can be used in other places such as lists -- although you need to be
careful about indentation in such cases.


“Include” Capabilities
----------------------

FORD uses Chris MacMackin's `Markdown-Include
<https://github.com/cmacmackin/markdown-include>`__ extension. The
syntax ``{!file-name.md!}`` in any of your documentation will be
replaced by the contents of file-name.md. This will be the first thing
done when processing Markdown, and thus all Markdown syntax within
file-name.md will be processed correctly. You can nest these include
statements as many times as you like. All file paths are evaluated
relative to the directory containing the project file, unless set to
do otherwise.

Environment Variables
---------------------

FORD uses Chris MacMackin's `ford.md_environ` extension (bundled with
FORD). The syntax ``${ENVIRONMENT_VAR}`` will be replaced by the
contents of environment variable ``ENVIRONMENT_VAR`` if it is defined,
or an empty string otherwise.

Aliases
-------

FORD allows the use of text macros or aliases to substitute for common
snippets, such as URLs. These are handy for internal links in the
documentation, such as to the `static pages <sec-writing-pages>`.
There are three predefined macros:

- ``|url|``: the `project URL <option-project_url>`
- ``|media|``: the (absolute) path to the `media directory <option-media_dir>`
- ``|page|``: the `static page directory <option-page_dir>`

You can define additional custom aliases with the `alias
<option-alias>` option.

.. note::
   Because the `markdown syntax for tables
   <https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/tables/>`_ also uses
   pipes, you should ensure there is whitespace around the pipes for
   tables and **no** whitespace in aliases:

   .. code:: markdown

       | Table Col 1 | Table Col 2 |
       | ----------- | ----------- |
       | note spaces | around pipes |
       | [link](|page|/subpage2.html) | |note_no_space_in_alias| |

   This avoids clashes between the syntax for the two features.


.. note::
   An alias can be escaped with a prepended baskslash, such that `|foo|` will
   be replaced with its alias, while `\|foo|` will be rendered as `|foo|`.


.. _writing-links:

Links
-----

In addition to conventional Markdown links, FORD provides its own syntax
for linking to other parts of the documentation. The general syntax for
this is ``[[component(type):item(type)]]``:

-  ``component`` is the name of the component of your project’s code
   whose documentation is to be linked to. It could be a procedure,
   module, or anything else with its own page of documentation. This is
   the only item which is mandatory.
-  ``type`` (optional) is ``component``\ ’s type of Fortran construct.
   This is necessary if you have multiple items with the same name (such
   as a type and its public constructor). If multiple items with the
   same name exist and ``type`` is not specified then FORD’s behaviour
   is undefined; it will link to the first of those items which it
   finds. The available options are:

   - "procedure", "proc", "subroutine", "function" for any kind of
     procedure defined within the project
   - "interface", "absinterface" for abstract interfaces
   - "block" for the legacy ``block data`` construct
   - "type"
   - "file"
   - "module"
   - "submodule"
   - "program"
   - "namelist"

   The majority of these can also be prefixed with "ext" to refer to
   entities defined in `external projects <option-external>`
-  ``item`` (optional) specifies an item within ``component`` which is
   to be linked to. The link’s target will be ``item``\ ’s location on
   ``component``\ ’s page. If ``item`` is not present then the colon in
   the link must be omitted.
-  ``type`` (optional, but ``item`` must also be present) is
   ``item``\ ’s type of Fortran construct. It can be used in the same
   manner as the component ``type``, but has different options:

   - "absinterface" for abstract interfaces
   - "bound" for type-bound procedures
   - "common" for ``common`` blocks
   - "constructor" for structure constructor procedures
   - "final" for finalization procedures
   - "function"
   - "interface"
   - "modproc" for module procedures in generic interfaces
   - "subroutine"
   - "type"
   - "variable"

   None of these options are interchangeable. If you specify an option
   that can not exist within ``component`` (for example, if
   ``component`` is a module and ``item`` is “bound”) then a warning
   message is issued and the link is not generated.

For example, to link to a module called ``my_mod`` you could
use ``[[my_mod]]`` or ``[[my_mod(module)]]``, while if you wanted to
refer to a function called ``my_function`` in that module you could
use any of (from least to most specific):

- ``[[my_function]]``
- ``[[my_function(function)]]``
- ``[[my_function(proc)]]``
- ``[[my_mod:my_function]]``
- ``[[my_mod(module):my_function]]``
- ``[[my_mod:my_function(function)]]``
- ``[[my_mod(module):my_function(function)]]``

If you have an overridden constructor a derived type, then it is
strongly recommended that you specify ``item`` should you wish to link
to either of them. Otherwise FORD will not know whether you are
referring to the derived type itself or the interface for its
constructor.

.. versionchanged:: 7.0.0
   Previously, links inside code blocks (with backticks) were
   resolved, now they are left verbatim, as with all other
   markup. That is, pre-v7, ```call [[my_subroutine]]``` would be
   rendered as ``call my_subroutine`` with a link to
   ``my_subroutine``, while now it will be left as: ``call
   [[my_subroutine]]``.

.. _non-fortran-source-files:

Non-Fortran Source Files
------------------------

As of version 4.5.0, FORD now offers limited support for non-Fortran
source files. While it will not analyze the code within such files, it
can extract documentation for the file as a whole and display it on its
own page, as done for Fortran source files. An attempt will also be made
to apply syntax highlighting to the contents of the file (although this
may fail if non-standard file extensions are used). This may be useful
for documenting build scripts or C wrappers.

To use this feature, the option ``extra_filetypes`` should be specified
in the `project
file <option-extra_filetypes>`.
It can hold multiple values, each of which should be on its own line.
Entries consist of the extension for the file-type which FORD is to
analyze and the comment character(s), separated by a space. FORD only
supports single-line comments. An example entry of this sort is

.. code:: text

   extra_filetypes: c   //
                    sh  #
                    py  #
                    tex %

To write documentation in these files, simply place one of the usual
documentation characters after the specified comment characters. Note
that the default documentation marker could cause problems in source
files using a “shebang” at the start.

**Experimental:** You can now explicitly specify the
`lexer <http://pygments.org/docs/lexers/>`__ for syntax highlighing by
adding its name next to the comment symbol:

.. code:: text

   extra_filetypes: inc ! fortran.FortranFixedLexer

Doxygen Documentation
------------------------

FORD now offers support for doxygen syntax. This allows comments and metadata
to be written using the doxygen comment system described in `this page 
<https://portal.eufus.eu/documentation/ITM/html/DoxygenFortran.html>`_. There
is currently no support for in line parameters and the doxygen metadata which
doesn't translate to ford metadata is ignored. Doxygen comments follow the ford 
predocumentation format.

In the doxygen format, parameters are refernced by ``@param`` followed by the
name followed by the comment. Currently there is no implementation to give 
directions in doxygen parameters, this is handled entierly through fords format

To link to another construct, doxygen uses the ``@see`` command followed by the
name of the construct to be linked to and then the rest of the comment. In doxygen,
the name of the link must come first, whereas in ford the name can come anywhere in the comment

In doxygen metadata is refrenced using ``@(meta)`` where meta is the name of the
metadata to be recorded. An extensive list of metadata is provided in ``settings.py``
howwever, where appropriate there is translations from doxygen identifiers to ford identifiers
in the ``read_metadata()`` function.
